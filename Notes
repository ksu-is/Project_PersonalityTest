- The max a person can score in a trait is 46.
- The min a person can score in a trait is 10.
- That is false. The above statements only apply to the Extraversion questions right now. 
- Extraversion questions have 5 + questions and 5 -.
- Conscientiousness has 6 + and 4 -. I am correcting that so there will be 5 each.
- Changed "Am exacting in my work?" (+) to "Waste time." (-)
- Changed "Feel others emotions" (+) to "Seek conflict." (-)
- All the signs for the 4th trait, neuroticism, were flipped. So I correct them to measure neuroticism. It was previously measuring Emotional Stability. It might sound more positive, but it isn't precise. Neuroticism is sensitivity to negative emotion, and that is a more precise trait to measure than stability because it is easier to recognize and define sensitivity to negative emotion rather than being insensitive to it.
- Changed "Get upset easily." (+) to "Rarely feel depressed." (-)
- Changed "Have frequent mood swings." (+) to "Rarely lose my composure." (-)
- Changed "Often feel blue."(+) to "Am not embarrassed easily." (-)
- Changed Openness questions to be even as well. 5 + and 5 -. 
  - Used the website (https://ipip.ori.org/BFASKeys.htm) to find the above examples of potential questions. It is based off the following scholarly article: "DeYoung, C. G., Quilty, L. C., & Peterson, J. B. (2007). Between facets and domains: 10 aspects of the Big Five. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 93, 880-896."
