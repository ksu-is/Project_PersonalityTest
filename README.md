# Our Goal is to create a unique personality test
The Big Five Aspect Scale personality test is universally recognized as an established standard and assessment 
evaluation method. The general consensus in academic psychology is that there are five fundamental 
personality traits. This model is assumed in most personality research, and is the basis of many of 
the most well regarded tests employed by psychologists who maintain close connections with academia. 
The "big five" tend to not be popular in consumer focused personality assessment or self-help 
because to many people the feedback of the model seems relatively basic. This test uses public domain scales 
from the International Personality Item Pool.
